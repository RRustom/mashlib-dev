# Browser tests

The purpose of this folder is to preserve legacy code that were written to test functionality "manually" in a browser,
e.g. you would open an HTML in your browser and look through the rendered view to check if there were any
deviations from what you expected.

No new tests should be written this way, since the execution and verification of functionality should be automated.
